> (submitted to [PLOS Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/).

In this folder we present the codes used to produce the modeling results that track the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil, China, Italy, Portugal and the United States. Under the folder
[dataset](PLOS_Comp_Biol_Paper/dataset), COVID-19 incidence data for these countries are presented (source: http://ourworldindata.org).
